# Abstract:
Who doesn't love a good game of rock, paper, scissors? I have created a virtual spinoff of this well known game so that any user can compete against the computer! There are two modes: Classic and Difficult. While the classic game has three choices, the difficult game has five.

# Context:
I am a current student at Turing School of Web Development and Design. This game was my final project for Module 1. Over the course of one week, I spent between two hours and eight hours per day completing this project.

# Learning Goals:
- Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
    - DRY JavaScript
    - event delegation to handle similar event listeners
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge

# Tech Used
- GitHub
- Terminal
- VS Code
- Chrome Browser/Dev tools

# Wins:
- I figured out how to write all HTML elements without having to refactor everything
- I made it pretty far in the project without having to reach out to someone for help

# Challenges:
- I had a lot of trouble with creating functions to play the game without sacrificing the functionality of my buttons
